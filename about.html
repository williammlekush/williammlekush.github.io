     <article class="About Me">
        <img class="headShot"></img>
        <p>I am a cautious optimist and disciplined pragmatist focused on creating delightful, empowering experiences. 
           I believe in design thinking as a method for interrogating and expressing human values. 
           My passions lie in interaction design, XR development, and craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>As a student at NYUAD, I study Interactive Media to understand interactions with current and emerging technologies,
            such as physical computing, augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence
            . These studies are complemented with concentrations in Psychology and Design,
             as a broad understanding of human behavior and the design process is key to creating meaningful experiences.
              Conceptually, I pursue methods of using and expanding the movement capacity of the human body.</p>

        <p>
         During the semester, I work as a Wood Shop assistant, improving my ability to fabricate by practicing traditional joinery and carpentry.
          When not making or thinking about making, I spend time cross-training movement disciplines
           (currently climbing, hand-balancing, floreio, and powerlifting) and backpacking wilderness areas.</p>
